I (Ulrik Lyngs) built the Facebook Minimiser as a Safari App Extension which does one thing only: hide the newsfeed, chat sidebar, and other distracting content on the front page of Facebook.

The extension collects zero data.

If you have any questions or suggestions, contact me at ulrik.lyngs@gmail.com.
