<p>`"No Distractions" for Facebook` works in a very simple manner: it injects a style sheet to facebook.com which locally hides the newsfeed, chat sidebar, and other distracting content on Facebook.</p>

<p>After youo have installed this app, the extension will appear in <strong>Safari > Preferences... > Extensions </strong>. Here, you can turn the extension off and on - or uninstall it.</p> 

<p>If you have any problems, contact me at ulrik.lyngs@gmail.com or create a GitHub issue on the repository <a href="https://github.com/ulyngs/no-distractions-for-facebook/">github.com/ulyngs/no-distractions-for-facebook/</a>.</p>
