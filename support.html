<p>The Facebook Minimiser works in a very simple manner: it injects a style sheet to facebook.com which locally hides the newsfeed, chat sidebar, and other distracting content on Facebook.</p>

<p>To turn the extension on and off after you have installed it, go to Safari > Preferences... > Extensions </p>

<p>If you have any problems, contact me at ulrik.lyngs@gmail.com or create a GitHub issue on the repository <a href="https://github.com/ulyngs/facebook-minimiser/">github.com/ulyngs/facebook-minimiser/</a>.</p>
